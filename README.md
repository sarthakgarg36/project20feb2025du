help me write readme file for my project GitHub
project name -Secret Santa Contract 
description - Description of the Secret Santa Gift Exchange Contract
              The Secret Santa Gift Exchange contract is a smart contract designed to facilitate a decentralized, 
              trustless Secret Santa gift exchange among a group of participants. 
              This contract allows users to sign up, get randomly assigned to another participant as their Secret Santa recipient,
              and confirm that the gift exchange has occurred. The owner of the contract has control over the assignment process, ensuring that the exchanges are fairly managed.
              smart contract address - 0xd4ddFD3cA2Eb918b3199Dc8a0D5Bac7688c7cd17.
