# Secret Santa Contract

## Description

The **Secret Santa Contract** is a decentralized application that randomly matches participants as gift givers and receivers. This contract automates the Secret Santa process, ensuring fairness and transparency in gift exchanges.

Participants can register, and once all participants have joined, the contract owner can trigger the matching process. Each participant is assigned to another as a Secret Santa, and they can confirm when the gift exchange is completed.

## Features

- **Register as a Participant**: Participants can join the Secret Santa gift exchange.
- **Random Matchmaking**: The contract randomly assigns participants to one another for gift giving.
- **Gift Exchange Confirmation**: Participants confirm the exchange once gifts are exchanged.
- **Secure & Transparent**: The entire process is automated and stored on the blockchain.

## Smart Contract Address

The deployed contract is available at the following address:  
`0xd4ddFD3cA2Eb918b3199Dc8a0D5Bac7688c7cd17`

## How to Use

1. **Register**: Call the `registerAsParticipant(name)` function to sign up.
2. **Owner Executes Matching**: The contract owner calls `assignSecretSanta()` to assign participants randomly.
3. **Confirm Exchange**: Once you've exchanged gifts, call `confirmGiftExchange()` to confirm.
